## About the Author

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
  Hey, my name's Adinath, and I'm a writer. I've spent over a year working on a book — still working on it.
  
  Below is a short monologue-style story. I wrote it to showcase what I can do.
  
  If you love it — support me.
  If you don't, forget I exist.

## Featured Work: "The Bunker Monologue"

<div style="background-color: #1A1A1A; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #FFA07A;">
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: #E0E0E0; line-height: 1.8;">
    I remember those joyful streets, the laughter of friends, the warmth of family dinners. When the world got defeated, so did my purpose.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    A coward's life — I defined myself in just three words.
    When I had my first kid, I swore to protect her from anything, but when the time came, I left them for my own good. I could have saved them, but I didn't risk it.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    I prayed to God — let them be eaten, not me. I prayed hard. When finally death struck my family, I laughed. I laughed when my family's blood sprayed all over. I laughed at their desperate weeping. I remember me back then.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Then I found a good old bunker. I'll live my life here — I thought. It was a paradise for a fucked-up world.
    I had that place all for me. All I had to do was to kill a man and his pregnant wife.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Three years I lived in that paradise. Then I finally got the guts to go out. But I had a question in my mind — living for the lost memories gives you purpose, but does it lower your value?
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Three years I hid myself to find guilt that I never had. I never cared about any of them.
    Am I real? I thought to myself. A sadistic person who is self-absorbed — but isn't that the life every man led?
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    I made a wishlist, for the day I get to step out of this bunker.
    The first thing I had on that list: video games —
    I could always see the smile other kids had when I walked past the arcade games. I wouldn't mind playing Pac-Man in those.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Second, I wanted to swim against the river flow, but never even saw any once I left my hometown for studies.
    Those computers at my office had those river pictures — I remember planning a trip, but I don't know what stopped me.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Does rain have the same smell as before? Or did it get ruined with blood?
    I want to run as fast as I can. I could have run with my children — but I killed them, didn't I?
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    I was too scared to see the sunlight, and I hid in the dark. I survived this long because of my fear. I will be able to see all these things I desired every day of my life after this outbreak.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    I could sense no fear in me. I wish it had happened sooner, but I had the resources I needed. These few minutes are choking me. It's getting hard to breathe now. Maybe because I'm thrilled to see the day, or is it something else?
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    Open it, coward — my mind said. And again.
    Open your eyes and see it for yourself.
    Did I open my eyes?
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    I hid in this big room with nothing but food past these years. My loneliness became my only friend, a small flicker of life in this desolate place. Today was the day it ended. The swarm of those zombies gave me company. It was exhausting, but something I never got for quite some time. Now I got no strength to wake up. I wished those creatures had left me a leg so that I could see the sunlight once again, but I think I am just unlucky.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    I didn't know time moved this fast inside this room. I had many things yet to be done, but it's too late to think about it now. I am losing my vision. I guess I belonged in the dark from the very beginning itself. For the last time, I want to remember the life I had before. I want to see my children again, and now I know that I am much worse than those zombies. Those kids needed a father but got a selfish prick. I hid myself in this dirty bunker for that — just food and nothing else. Now I remember that day, packing my bag with my family for the trip to that river at my hometown. They were happy, and they raced to the car, and I lost. I was the last one to get to the car. The swarm of the zombies were faster. I was shocked at first. I couldn't imagine watching my life getting devoured in front of me. They screamed for me — but what did I do? It's — it's all in my head now. I ran away from them, didn't I? Did I really laugh, or did I cry?
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    The bunker. I'll miss the day I first met you. A rotting man welcomed me inside, and his wife — her baby waving at me from her torn belly. Did I wave back, or did I kill them?
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    My final breath is near. I will die alone in the grave I found years ago, with no hands to wipe my own tears and no legs to walk towards the light. The last thing I had on my list is to hold a mirror, to witness the villain of my own story's death.
